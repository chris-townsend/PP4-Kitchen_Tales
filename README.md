## Objective
#

***

## Brief & Target Audience
#
A visitor to Kitchen Tales would be someone who is most likely an adult who enjoys their food and trying new recipes
***

## User Experience (UX)
#


### User Stories
#


#### EPIC | Early Deployment
- 

#### EPIC | Initial Django Setup
- 

#### EPIC | User Recipe Management
- 

#### EPIC | Website Functionality
-

#### EPIC | Navigation
-

#### EPIC | Admin Features & Owner Objectives
-

#### EPIC | User Account Management
-

***

#### User stories not yet implemented
#

The following user stories were scoped out of the project due to time constraints and labelled as "Won't Have" on the project board on Github. It is intended that these user stories will be implemented at a later date. 

***

### Design
#
The site has a very simple and clean design which was purposely chosen in order to keep in theme with the site's goal. i.e. invoking a sense of calm in the user and reducing stress when it comes to everyday cooking.

## Agile Methodology
#
Github projects was used to manage the development process using an agile approach. Please see link to project board [here](https://github.com/chris-townsend)

The 7 Epics listed above were documented within the Github project as Milestones. A Github Issue was created for each User Story which was then allocated to a milestone(Epic). Each User Story has defined acceptance criteria to make it clear when the User Story has been completed. The acceptance criteria are further broken down into tasks to facilitate the User Story's execution.

## Data Model
I used principles of Object-Oriented Programming throughout this project and Djangoâ€™s Class-Based Generic Views.  

Django AllAuth was used for the user authentication system.

In order for the users to create recipes a custom recipe model was required. The recipe author is a foreign key to the User model given a recipe can only have one author.

The Comment model allows users to comment on individual recipes and the Recipe is a foreign key in the comment model given a comment can only be linked to one recipe. 


The diagram below details the database schema.

![Database Schema]()

***
## Testing
#

Testing and results can be found [here](/TESTING.md)

***
## Security Features and Defensive Design
#
### User Authentication
#
- Django's LoginRequiredMixin is used to make sure

### Form Validation
If incorrect or empty data is added to a form, the form won't submit and a warning will appear to the user informing them what field raised the error. 

### Database Security
The database url and secret key are stored in the env.py file to prevent unwanted connections to the database and this was set up before the first push to Github.

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens were used on all forms throughout this site.

### Custom error pages:

Custom Error Pages were created to give the user more information on the error and to provide them with buttons to guide them back to the site.

- 400 Bad Request - The Easy Eater is unable to handle this request.
- 403 Page Forbidden - Looks like you're trying to access forbidden content. Please log out and sign in to the correct account.
- 404 Page Not Found - The page you're looking for doesn't exist.
- 500 Server Error - The Easy Eater is currently unable to handle this request

## Features
